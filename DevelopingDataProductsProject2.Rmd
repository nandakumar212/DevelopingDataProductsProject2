## Analysis of mtcars dataset

Here we perform a simple plot using plotly on the mtcars data set to see how mpg(y-axis) changes with weight(x-axis), horsepower (z-axis) and gear (color).
   
    
   
#### *Note : Please use Google Chrome if the plot in the next slide is not visible.*

*** 
```{r cars, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(RColorBrewer)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~ wt, y = ~ mpg, z = ~ hp, type = "scatter3d", 
        color = ~ factor(gear), colors = brewer.pal(3, "Set2"))
```
